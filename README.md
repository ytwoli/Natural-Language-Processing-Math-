# Libraries 
## LaTeXXML
LaTeXML can be used to convert TEX/LaTeX documents into HTML files, which is a markup language that represents structured data. This conversion process allows for easier manipulation, storage and exchange of the document's content. XML is often used for data interchange between different systems, and it provides a hierarchical structure that can be easily processed by various tools and applications. This software system is particularly useful when you want to repurpose LaTeX documents for other purposes, such as web publishing, data analysis, or integration with other software systems.
